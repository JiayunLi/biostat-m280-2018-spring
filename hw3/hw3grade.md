### Overall Grade: 93/100

### Quality of report: 10/10

* Is the homework submitted (git tag time) before deadline?

	Yes. `2018-05-25 17:09:52 -0700` for tag `hw3`. 
	
* Is the final report in a human readable format html? 

	Yes. `html`.

* Is the report prepared as a dynamic document (Jupyter notebook) for better reproducibility?  

	Yes. `ipynb`.

* Is the report clear (whole sentences, typos, grammar)? Do readers have a clear idea what's going on and how are results produced by just reading the report?

    Yes, the report is clear and easy to read
 
### Correctness and efficiency of solution: 45/50 

* Q1 (20/20)

  **efficiency** (5/5 pts)
 
  **correctness**(15/15 pts)
    I can see you get the correct answer, don't forget to give beta. ^_^
	
* Q2 (25/30)

Notice in Dr. Zhou's answer, he set all the diagonal elements of A to be 0. Your answer for Q2 may be different from Dr. Zhou's answer.

Q2(1) (1/3pts)

 Your `Q` is not sparse.

Q2(2) (3/3pts) Good job!
Q2(3) (6/6pts)

number of pages: right (500)
number of edges: right (11158)
number of dangling nodes (pages with no out links) right (96)
which page has max in-degree? right ("http://www.ucla.edu")
which page has max out-degree? right ("http://giveto.ucla.edu")
visualize the sparsity pattern of  A: good


Q2(4) (12/12pts) 

1) (3 / 3 pts): Good job!

2) (3 / 3 pts): You are on the right track, but the structure in part one is wrong. Please check Prof. Zhou's answer

3) (3 / 3 pts): Good job!

4) (3 / 3 pts): Same as 2)

Q2(5) (0 / 3pts) You answer for part 4 is right but the conclusion in this part is wrong

Q2(6) (3 / 3pts): Good job!



### Usage of Git: 10/10

* Are branches (`master` and `develop`) correctly set up? Is the hw submission put into the `master` branch?

	Yes.
	
* Are there enough commits? Are commit messages clear? 

	 Yes. 
	
* Is the hw3 submission tagged?

	Yes.

* Are the folders (`hw1`, `hw2`, ...) created correctly? 

	Yes.

* Do not put a lot auxillary files into version control.  

	Yes. 

### Reproducibility: 9/10

* Are the materials (files and instructions) submitted to the `master` branch sufficient for reproducing all the results?  (-1 pt)

	I cannot load the file `A.txt` in chunk 11
	

* If necessary, are there clear instructions, either in report or in a separate file, how to reproduce the results?  

	Not applicable for hw3.
    

### Julia code style: 19/20

* Rule (4): 4 spaces for indenting.
